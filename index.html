  <h2 class="faq-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <div class="faq-container">
    <!-- FAQ 1 -->
    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
        Will solar panels work during power cuts or at night?
        <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
      Standard rooftop solar systems are grid-tied, which means they work only when the power grid is active. During a power cut, these systems shut down for safety reasons unless you’ve opted for a hybrid solar system with battery backup.
At night, since solar panels need sunlight to generate electricity, they don’t produce power. However, net metering ensures that the excess solar energy you export during the day offsets your nighttime usage, keeping your electricity bill low.
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- FAQ 2 -->
    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
        How much space do I need on my roof to install solar panels?
        <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        As a rule of thumb, a 1 kW system requires around 80–100 sq. ft. of shadow-free roof area. For a typical home with a monthly bill of ₹2,000–₹3,000, a 3–5 kW system is usually sufficient, which needs 300–500 sq. ft. of usable roof space.
Flat concrete rooftops are ideal, but we can also work with sloped roofs or terrace railings using customized mounting structures.
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- FAQ 3 -->
    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
        What is the upfront cost of installing a solar system for my home?
        <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        The cost depends on the system size and whether you're opting for battery backup. For most homes, a 3 kW system without batteries may cost around ₹1.5–2 lakh after subsidies.
Thanks to the PM Surya Ghar scheme, residential customers are eligible for up to 40% subsidy, and we help you handle all paperwork for availing this benefit. Financing and EMI options are also available.
      </div>
    </div>
     <!-- FAQ 4 -->
    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
       What kind of maintenance will I need to do at home?
        <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
       Solar systems are low maintenance. As a homeowner, you just need to clean the panels every 15–30 days with water and a soft cloth to remove dust and bird droppings.
We recommend annual inspections to check wiring, inverter health, and performance. If you prefer, we also offer Annual Maintenance Contracts (AMCs) so you don’t have to worry about upkeep at all.

     <!-- FAQ 6 -->
    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
       What are the primary benefits of installing a solar rooftop system?
        <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
         Installing a solar rooftop system brings a host of advantages. First and foremost, it offers substantial reductions in electricity costs, with savings of up to 60% on energy bills. Solar panels also allow homeowners and businesses to make productive use of idle roof spaces by converting them into power generators.
Beyond financial savings, solar power contributes meaningfully to the environment by reducing carbon emissions—each unit of solar electricity generated can prevent around 0.8 kg of CO₂ emissions. Additionally, solar energy systems help properties achieve sustainability certifications and net-zero targets while enhancing the visual appeal of the building with modern, sleek panel designs.
      </div>

<!-- FAQ 13 -->
    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
      How does net metering work and how does it help reduce carbon emissions?
        <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
       Net metering is a mechanism that allows you to feed excess solar electricity back into the grid. In return, your utility company credits you for the surplus, which offsets your electricity consumption during times when your panels aren’t producing enough (like nighttime).
This results in lower electricity bills and maximizes the return on your investment.
From an environmental perspective, every kilowatt-hour (kWh) generated by your solar rooftop reduces about 0.8 kg of carbon dioxide emissions. By switching to solar, you contribute significantly toward combating climate change and moving India closer to its green energy targets. </div>
